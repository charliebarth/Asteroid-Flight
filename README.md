# Asteroid-Flight

Asteroid Flight is a javascript and rails app. It has a rails api backend to create and store users and their games. The frontend is constructed of html, css, and javascript. The premise of the game is the user controls a spaceship and must navigate through an asteroid field as long as possible without crashing.

# Usage and Setup

To install the app simply fork and clone this repository from Github onto your local device.

To setup the app, change directory into the backend run bundle install, 'rails db:migrate', 'rails db:seed' and then run 'rails s'. Then change directory into the frontend and open index.html. Everything should now be set up!
